# ProtoHook
Potentially the most blasphemous project in JS yet.

Protohook hooks onto the prototype functions in JS objects and intercepts them to create a seamless pub-sub type system.

## Is this dangerous?

Probably. I'll be testing it out in a few projects before determining if it's work pursuing.
